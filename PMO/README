There are two data formats used by the scripts:
data.csv -- the original data file, a csv file downloaded from Google Sheets.
series.csv -- an ordered sequence of every event with a specific YYYY-MM-DD time. Some events only have months or years. They are not included here. This is generated from data.csv by mkseries.csv
times.csv -- a sequence of all the times of day, generated from data.csv by mktimes.sh.
The data files are in the Data subdirectory.

== Scripts for generating data ==

As mentioned above, mktimes.sh and mkseries.sh generate, respectively, time of day and date data from data.csv.

== Scripts for generating plots ==

months_since.py: calculates a bar chart of the event counts per month since Jan 2020. How to execute:
>>> python3 months_since.py series.csv 'Events per Month Since Jan 2020'

heatmap.py: generates a heatmap of the events with specific dates. Execute: >>> python3 heatmap.py series.csv 'Heatmap of Events'

time-dist.py: generates a bar plot of all the times of day. It reads from times.csv. Execute: >>> python3 time-dist.py

days.py: generates a plot of all the events by day of the week. Execute: >>> python3 time-dist.py data.csv 'Distribution of events by Time of Day'
